# Classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game

## Description
The game I have created is a classic version of the Rock Paper Scissors game. This game is single-player only, where the user tries to beat the computer. The user will choose one of three choices and at the same time the computer makes its random choice. Randomness governs the game.

The rules are:

- Rock beats scissors; 

- Scissors beat paper; 

- Paper beats rock. 


It is intended for people who want to experience a simple JavaScript game and see how it works.

## User Experience

### Design

My intention was to design a simple and minimalistic website, with essential information easily accessible.


### Website's goals



### I can achieve my goal most effectively through this website because



### Ideal viewers


  
### User stories



### Wireframes

Below are the wireframes I created during the design process (whose aspect and colour slightly differ from the final product):


### Palette

The colour palette was generated from the hero image using [color-hex](https://www.color-hex.com/). It was intended to use some colors that evoke the image of a robot.

### Typography

The entire website uses the "Roboto Mono" font, with monospace serving as the fallback font in case the font isn't imported properly.
The font was imported into style.css using Google fonts.

### Favicon

The favicon was created using [Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/).

I chose an image of a robot that represents the machine the player attempts to beat.
