# Classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game

## Description
This game is a classic version of the Rock Paper Scissors game. It is single-player only, where the user tries to beat the computer. The player will select one of three choices and at the same time the computer will make its random choice. 
Randomness governs the game.

The rules are:

- Rock beats scissors; 
- Scissors beat paper; 
- Paper beats rock. 


It is intended for people who want to experience a simple JavaScript game and see how it works.

## User Experience

### Design

My goal was to create a classic 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' game where the player fights against a machine. The page design is simple, with cold colours that evoke a robotic theme.


### Project's goal
The goal of this project was to put the skills I learned studying JavaScript into practice by creating a simple and fun game that would be enjoyable for casual players as well as JavaScript beginners.

I can achieve my goal most effectively through this project because I can practice basic JavaScript functions while creating a simple and interactive game.

### Ideal viewers
- A JavaScript learner who wants to see a simple game in action.
- A Rock, Paper, Scissors game enthusiast.
- Someone who wants to distract themselves from daily tasks by playing an online game.
- Someone who's got a basic knowledge of English, as the options are in English.

### Palette

The colour palette was generated from the hero image using [color-hex](https://www.color-hex.com/). As I said, I wanted some colors that evoke the image of a robot.

### Typography

The entire website uses the "Roboto Mono" font, with monospace serving as the fallback font in case the font isn't imported properly.
The font was imported into style.css using Google fonts.

### Favicon

The favicon was created using [Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/).

I chose an image of a robot that represents the machine the player attempts to beat.
